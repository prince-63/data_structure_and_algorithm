####**What is a variables?**
A variable in computer programming is a symbolic name or identifier that is used to store and represent data in a program. Variables are a fundamental concept in programming because they allow you to manipulate and work with data, perform calculations, and store values for later use. Here are some key characteristics of variables:

- **Name:** Variables have names that programmers choose to uniquely identify them within a program. Variable names typically follow certain rules, such as starting with a letter or underscore, and they are case-sensitive in many programming languages.


- **Data Type:** Each variable has a data type that determines what kind of data it can hold. Common data types include integers, floating-point numbers, characters, strings, booleans, and more complex types like arrays and objects.

- **Value:** Variables can hold data values. These values can be assigned when the variable is declared or later in the program. The value of a variable can be changed as needed during the program's execution.

- **Scope:** Variables have a scope that defines where in the program they can be accessed or modified. Local variables are limited to a specific block of code, while global variables can be accessed from anywhere in the program.

- **Lifetime:** Variables have a lifetime that determines how long they exist in memory. Local variables typically exist only within the scope in which they are declared, while global variables often persist for the duration of the program's execution.


    ```java
    DataType Variable_name = Value;

    // example
    int number = 10;
    String name = "Prince Kumar"
    char character = 'a';
    Double marks = 78.7483;
    float marks = 50.3;

    // here number, name, character, marks are variable names
    ```
